## 1 Protein–protein and protein–nucleic acid binding site
prediction via interpretable hierarchical geometric deep
learning (GigaScience, 2024)

**Model name**: GraphRBF

**Aim**: protein binding sites, residue binding patterns！protein–protein and protein–nucleic acid binding sites (protein–DNA, and protein–RNA)

**Framework**: an enhanced graph neural network + a prioritized radial basis function neural network (capture the local residue spatial distributions) + a new radial basis function (termed gentle decay Gaussian-like function) + a kernel attention mechanism.

**Type**: classification

**Traits**: end-to-end, interpretable, hierarchical geometric deep learning model, residue information interaction based on molecular graphs, residue spatial distributions, <sequencec, structure> + <Notes, edges, coords>.

**Weak popints**: only utilizes protein local structures, ignoring information of the overall structure.

**Code source**: Y
